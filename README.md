# Introduction
This is an example that demonstrate the ease of use of ASoC's powerful REST API capabilities by integrating ASoC SAST security scan with Github Actions. 

Within 7 simple REST API method calls, we were was able to check out a source code from a github repo, have a SAST scan submitted into ASoC for static analysis and get scan result/report back. 

The example shows the process of scanning a .net core project. The full YAML script is in the file config.yml

# ASoC REST API used in this example 

`Account/ApiKeyLogin`

`/FileUpload`

`/Scans/StaticAnalyzer`

`/Scans/$scan_ID/Executions`

`/Reports/Security/Scan/$scan_ID`

`/Reports/$report_ID`

`/Reports/Download/$report_ID`

## Step 2. Ensure the presence of appscan-config.xml in the code repo

The appscan-config.xml is generated by running the AppScan Go utility. For instructions on how to use AppScan Go, see link:
